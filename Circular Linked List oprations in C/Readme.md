 ✨ Welcome to the Circular Linked List Wizard! ✨


     Step into a mystical realm where circular linked lists come to life with the magic of C programming. Harness the power of spells (a.k.a. functions) to summon, banish, and reveal nodes in an ever-looping enchanted chain.

Key Features (a.k.a. Spells 🪄):

     📜  Summon Nodes: Add nodes to the beginning or the end of your linked list in a flash.
     ❌ Banish Nodes: Remove pesky nodes from either end with a flick of your wand.
     👀   Reveal the List: Behold the entire circular linked list in its glory with a neat, intuitive format (e.g., 10 -> 20 -> ... -> (HEAD)).
Error Protection: Gracefully handle edge cases like empty lists—no magical mishaps here!
🧹 Memory Management: Ensure proper allocation and deallocation of memory—this magical land is free of memory leaks.
