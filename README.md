**What's Inside the Data Structure Party? 🎉**

       1. The Basics, But Powerful 💥 

          Structs: Simple but mighty.
          
          Singly Linked Lists: One step at a time, link by link.

          Doubly Linked Lists: Double the links, double the fun!

          Queue: First come, first served — the line of code never lies.

          Stack: Last in, first out — the tower of order and chaos.

          Tree: Branch out, grow deep — nature’s blueprint in code.
    
       2. Algorithm Adventures 🏃‍♂️ 

          Insert, Delete, Search: Get ready for some action!

          Traversal Algorithms: Go deep (DFS) or wide (BFS), the choice is yours.

          Sorting Algorithms: Quick Sort, Merge Sort – get your data in line!



**What’s Coming Next? 🎉 (Get Excited) 🔮**

         1. The Basics, But Powerful 💥
   
          Doubly Linked Lists: Double the links, double the fun!
   
          Stacks: LIFO – Last In, First Out, but it’s still fun!
   
          Queues: FIFO – the order you can count on!
   
     
          2 . Get Advanced, Get Cool 🔥
   
          Binary Search Trees: Log(n) searching – ‘cause who’s got time to search slow?
   
          AVL Trees: Balancing your trees, keeping them in check.
   
          Heaps: Organizing data the smart way.
     
          Graphs: From nodes to edges, let's connect the dots.
