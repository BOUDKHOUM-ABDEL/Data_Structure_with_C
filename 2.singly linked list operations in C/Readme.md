✨ Welcome to the Linked List Wizard! 

    This program transforms the mystical world of singly linked lists into an interactive and fun experience. With just a sprinkle of 
    your input and some C magic, you can build, manipulate, and display linked lists dynamically. ✨

Key Features (a.k.a. Spells 🪄):

        📜 Summon Nodes: Add nodes to the beginning or the end of your linked list in a flash.
        ❌ Banish Nodes: Remove pesky nodes from the start or end with ease.
        👀 Reveal the List: Display your entire linked list in a clean, magical format (10 -> 20 -> NULL).
        🛡️ Error Protection: Handles edge cases gracefully (e.g., trying to delete from an empty list? Not on our watch!).
        🧹 Clean Memory: Ensures memory is dynamically allocated and deallocated properly—no memory leaks in this 
          enchanted realm! 🧙‍♀️


Follow the wizard's menu to control your linked list:


    ------------------------🪄 MENU 🪄------------------------
     1. Add a node at the beginning. 🪄
     2. Add a node at the end. 🔚

     4. Remove a node from the end. 🗑️
     5. Display the list. 👀
     6. Exit the wizardry. ✨

      🧑‍🎓 Learning Tool: Perfect for apprentices (students!) learning the arcane arts of linked lists in C.
      📚 Algorithm Wizardry: A stepping stone for advanced data structure spells like sorting, searching, or reversing a 
         linked list.
