✨ The Queue Kingdom ✨

Welcome to the Queue Kingdom, where order reigns supreme!
👑 Every newcomer patiently lines up at the end, and the first to arrive is the first to be served
— the sacred law of FIFO (First-In, First-Out).

Key Features (Royal Decrees 🪄):

📥 Enqueue: Add new elements to the royal line (at the back of the queue).
📤 Dequeue: Serve the oldest element waiting at the front.
🛑 Check Fullness: Prevents overflow by respecting the queue’s maximum capacity.
⚡ Check Emptiness: Detects when the queue is empty — no ghosts allowed!
👀 Traversal: Values are displayed in the exact order of entry and exit.

Royal Rules of the Menu:

Enter the maximum size of your queue.

Keep adding values until the line is full.

Watch them leave in perfect order — the first in is the first out.

Applications (Where the Queue Rules 👑):

🔄 Task Scheduling: Perfect for printers, CPU process queues, or round-robin scheduling.
📚 Learning Tool: Great for students practicing FIFO data structures in C.
🚦 Real-World Scenarios: Ticket counters, supermarket lines, and traffic management
— queues are everywhere!
