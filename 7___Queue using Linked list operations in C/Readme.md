✨ The Dynamic Queue Adventure ✨

Step right up! 🎩✨ You’ve entered the world of the Linked List Queue, where elements join the line at the rear and gracefully exit from the front.
This isn’t your ordinary fixed-size queue — it grows and shrinks dynamically with every operation.

Key Features (Superpowers 🪄):

📥 Enfiler (Enqueue) – Add values to the end of the queue.
📤 Defiler (Dequeue) – Remove the value at the front of the queue.
👀 Afficher (Show) – Display the current state of the queue in order.
🛡️ Vide Check – Prevents crashes when trying to remove from an empty queue.
♾️ Dynamic Size – The queue expands and contracts as needed thanks to linked list magic.
